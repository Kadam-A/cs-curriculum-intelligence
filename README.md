# CS Curriculum Intelligence System

Graph-based analysis of Computer Science curriculum using Neo4j and Graph Data Science concepts.

## Project Overview
Built as a self-directed learning project to explore graph databases and apply them to real curriculum data. Analyzes course relationships, identifies critical courses, and finds optimal learning paths.

## Key Insights Discovered
- **CS214 (Data Structures)** is the most critical course - highest connectivity to other courses
- **CS114** serves as the primary entry point with no prerequisites  
- Multiple learning paths available from foundation to advanced courses
- Clear progression structure from Level 1 to Level 4 courses

## Technologies Used
- Neo4j Graph Database
- Cypher Query Language  
- Graph Data Science concepts
- Neo4j Sandbox (cloud-based)

## Analysis Performed
1. **Course Importance Rankings** - Identified most connected/critical courses
2. **Learning Path Analysis** - Mapped routes from beginner to advanced courses
3. **Prerequisite Dependencies** - Analyzed course connection patterns
4. **Entry Point Identification** - Found courses with no prerequisites

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with graph databases
- Understanding of graph data modeling
- Practical application of Neo4j and Cypher
- Real-world problem solving with graph analytics

*Built during July 2025 as part of self-directed learning in graph databases.*
